# Data and Plotting procedures

This folder contains the necessary data and scripts to reproduce
theoretical results presented in the paper
titled "Magnetization reversal through an antiferromagnetic state"
([arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05028)). 

## Field sweeps

The data can be extracted using the MATLAB script
named "plotrawdata.m". The averaged magnetization and electric polarization
varying along the field sweep can be visualized using
"plotrawdata.m", "plotrawdataforPaper25K.m" and
"plotrawdataforPaper25K.m" scripts. The resulting output consists of two pdf outputs
that can be found in this folder. 

## State snapshots

State snapshots in various intermediate values of the applied magnetic
field can be visualized using "plotMovieSnapshots.m" script. The codes
for saving the intermediate states can be
found in the "SaveSnapshots" folder.

Feel free to explore the provided data and utilize the scripts to
reproduce the results mentioned in the paper. Please don't hesitate to
reach out for any further inquiries or assistance.
